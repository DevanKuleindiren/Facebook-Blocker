Facebook Blocker
=================

## Description
Facebook Blocker is a Safari extension that allows you to block Facebook for a fixed amount of time, a perfect tool when leading up to exams! (When I say block, I mean preventing you accessing anything with "facebook." in the URL)

## Screenshots
You can set how long you want to block Facebook for.
